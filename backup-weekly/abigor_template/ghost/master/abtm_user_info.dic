// This was written expecting a variable (here called firstBoot) to be set to indicate if OnTeachName was called from OnFirstBoot, starting a sequence that gets the user's name, pronouns, and birthdate consecutively. In this code, "firstBoot == 1" means that this is the first time the ghost has been installed, or in OnFirstBoot "reference0 == 0". "firstBoot == 2" means that this in NOT the first time the ghost has been installed, or in OnFirstBoot "reference0" having any other value than 0.
