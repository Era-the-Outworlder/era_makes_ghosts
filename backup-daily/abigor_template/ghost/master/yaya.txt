// ----- Dictionary Files -----
// These are where all the content is. The methods of defining them are: 

// dic, filename  OR  dic, filename, charset
// where the final serparating comma and charset are optional. This allows importing of dictionaries from other sources without needing to reencode them.

// dicif, filename  OR  dicif, filename, charset
// dicif operates like dic, but ignores the specified file if it isn't found.

// dicdir, dirname  OR  dicdir, dirname, charset
// Reads all files under the specified directory as a single dictionary, but reads those files in no set order.
