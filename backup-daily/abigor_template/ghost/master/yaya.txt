// dic, filename  OR  dic, filename,charset
// where the final serparating comma and charset are optional. This allows importing of dictionaries from other sources without needing to reencode them.

// dicif operates like dic, but ignores the specified file if it isn't found.

// dicdir, dirname  OR  dicdir, dirname, charset
// Reads all files under the specified directory as a single dictionary, but reads those files in no set order.

// ----- Error Handling -----

// -- Error Log --

//Sets the file path of the event log. Seems to be duplicated in other parts of the program

// -- Log Filtering --
// Log filtering has 2 modes: 
// "Do not output matching content", indicated as "blacklist" or "denylist", is the default mode.
// "Output ONLY matching content", indicated as "whitelist" or "allowlist"

// -- Message List --
// Points to a file to specify what languages list of error messages to draw from. Best to use an officially sourced one unless you're writing for an unsupported language.

// -- Function Depth --
// Maximum function depth before failure. Default 32. Minimum 2. Set to 0 to not check upper limit.

// Controls the max iterations of a loop before failure. Default is 10000. 0 to disable limit.
