Heya! I'm Era the Outworlder, thanks for stopping by! Hope you enjoy this, I enjoyed making it. You can pester me, ask for help, or submit bugs at theoutworlder.tumblr.com or better yet at Era the Outworlder#8203 on Discord.

I owe an unending amount of gratitude to Zarla-s (take a look at those links in the r-click menu) for her English template and tutorial site, without which this never would have been possible. Check her out, she does some awesome stuff.

If you're familiar with it already, and the base code included, you'll noticed a few things I changed/added. The biggest thing by far was a new function to teach custom pronouns, so people whose pronouns are like ze/zir can be included (even though I'm not sure I ever call that envelope in dialogue. Whoops!) because just because I don't know all the possible pronouns, doesn't mean people should feel excluded.

You can feel free to take that to use in other ukagaka, just pls give me credit, k?

I did all the art/animations myself, I'd appreciate if you didn't redistribute them seperately from the ghost.

Feel free to modify for your own use, and if you've done extensive modifications to the code but still want to use the art and you would like to distribute YOUR version of f_lowe_y the ghost, come chat with me! I'm not against it, I'd just like to be able to link to it.


Anyway, have a nice day!
